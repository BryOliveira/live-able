# live-able
The site can be accessed [here](https://liveable-zeta.vercel.app).

A web-app for the MySQL based CLI app "affor-db" built using Next.js and Prisma.
The app lets you cross-reference job listings for various locations against the median house prices of the states those jobs are in and see how "liveable" the salary is.

The job listings are queried from a MySQL database and are not regularly updated as they're taken from a Kaggle dataset.
The median house price is processed data from Zillow's public datasets on current house sale prices.
